# Project Title

PID CONTROLLER MONITORING, ASSESSMENT AND OPTIMIZATION SYSTEM BASED ON MACHINE LEARNING AND SIMATIC IOT2050

## Description

> In fact, the controller using the PID algorithm is very commonly used, it is often applied in the heating, cooling, motor control processes... Because this is a simple and easy method. applications in various closed-loop control systems. However, in order to achieve the best results, the PID parameters used in the calculation must be adjusted according to the specific characteristics of the system. Selecting the parameters of the controller is often difficult because the regulator needs to have experience and understanding of the system, and the auto-tuning software sometimes gives unsatisfactory results.

> During the long operation of a system, the control objects can be changed, the disturbances can cause deviations that cause the system to operate incorrectly, affecting the output product.

> Therefore, "The system of monitoring, evaluation and optimization of PID controllers based on Machine Learning and SIMATIC IOT 2050" was born to create a solution for businesses to check and evaluate the quality indicators of their products. an industrial control system, giving warnings for users to promptly adjust to avoid affecting the quality of output products, automatically adjusting the parameters of the PID controller by applying Machine Learning to give the most optimal results, meeting the requirements of the system.
